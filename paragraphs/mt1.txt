Madre Tierra is a family-owned and operated brand of fine cigars, all hand made in Tamboril, Dominican Republic. Our blended Cigars compliment the finest tobacco grown in Ecuador and Dominican Republic and we own the entire process from "seed to smoke".

​

Madre Tierra has been blending cigars since 1982 and just recently owners Juanna De La Cruz, John Deans and Jacob Senior introduced the cigars to the U.S.
