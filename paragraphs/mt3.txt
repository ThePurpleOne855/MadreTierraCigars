Madre Tierra made it's first major debut during a "cut-n-light* event for Smoke.

Rings-72, a local cigar lounge located in Merrit Island FL. www.smokering72.com

During the event the Habano flew off the shelf faster than it could be restocked. The trend continues to this day with the Habano (red-label) quickly becoming their highest rated and #I Seller in the U.S. (next to the San Andreas). Steadily as popularity continued so did Madre Tierra's reach into some of the most prostegious cigar lounges across Central Florida, Texas, and abroad.

Almost half of all the worlds finest cigars originate from Domincan Republic and Madre Tierra is certainly living up to the standard of producing quality cigars full of robust Dominican flavors with hints of cedar. spices, nuts, coffee and a even licorice as you work your way to the nub. Premium hand rolled cigars are and will always be about the tabacco and Madre Tierra takes pride in owning the entire cultivating process from seed to smoke. so you can be garunteed the very best every time you smoke itâ€¦..enjoy!
